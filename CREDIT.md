# Developed with

* [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/) & [CLANG](https://clang.llvm.org/) - The Outstandingly-Designed *FLOSS* Compilers. They are the essential parts of Alton.

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - The Popular, Rich, and *open-source* IDE.

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) - The Master of the masters of *Free* compile automation!

* [Diagrams.net](https://www.diagrams.net/) - The Coolest and most flexible *Open Source* diagram drawer EVER!

* [Krita](https://krita.org/) - The *Freely available*, Most Capable, and the *Easiest-to-learn*, drawing program, from the [KDE](https://kde.org/).

* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - The *Public Domain* documentation collection for nearly everything!

* And many other amazing, *free*, and capable software, like [Fish](https://fishshell.com), [Konsole](https://konsole.kde.org/), [GNU/Linux](https://www.gnu.org/), ...

You may notice that nearly every software behind the development of Alton is *"Free"*. The reason for that is:

* Alton supports their user's privacy,
* Alton supports the idea of *"Application on server, Developers all around the world"*, and
* Alton itself is a [FLOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), so it shall support other FLOSSes.
